Lyrics: 
Baby you can
Find me under the lights
Diamonds under my eyes
Turn the rhythm up
Don’t you wanna just
Come along for the ride

Oh my outfit so tight
You can see my heart beat tonight
I can take the heat
Baby best believe
That’s the moment I shine

Cuz every romance
Shakes and it bends
Don’t give a damn

When the nights here
I don’t do tears
Baby no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won’t see it on my face
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I’ll still keep the party running not one hair out of place

Lately I’ve been
Moving close to the edge
Still be looking my best
I stay on the beat
You can count on me
I ain’t missing no steps

Cuz every romance
Shakes and it bends
Don’t give a damn

When the nights here
I don’t do tears
Baby no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance 
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won’t see it on my face 
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I’ll still keep the party running not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks
You’ll never see it, never see it
When my world shakes
I feel alive, I feel alive
I don’t play safe
Don’t you know about me

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Even when the tears are flowing
They’re diamonds on my face
I’ll still keep the party going not one hair out of place
Even when the tears are flowing
They’re diamonds on my face
I’ll still keep the party going not one hair out of place

Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won’t see it on my face
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I’ll still keep the party running not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks
You’ll never see it, never see it
When my world shakes
I feel alive, I feel alive
I don’t play safe
Don’t you know about me

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Dance the night

About Dua Lipa:

Zach Bryan - I Remember Everything (feat. Kacey Musgraves),"Rot gut whiskey’s gonna ease my mind
Beach town rests on the “drying” line
Do I remind you of your daddy in his 88 Ford?
Labrador hanging out the passenger door
The sand from your hair is blowing in my eyes
Blame it on the beach grown men don’t cry

Do you remember that beatdown basement couch
I’d sing you my love songs and you’d tell me about
How your momma ran off and pawned her ring
I remember, I remember everything

A cold shoulder a closing time 
you were begging me to stay till the sun rose
Strange words come on out of a grown man’s mouth when his minds broke
Pictures and passing time you only smile like that when you’re drinking
I wish I didn’t but I do, remember every moment on the nights with you

You’re drinking everything to ease your mind
When in the hell are you gonna ease mine
You’re like concrete feet in the summer heat
It burns like hell when two souls meet 
And you’ll never be the man you always swore
But I’ll remember your singing in that ’88 Ford

A cold shoulder a closing time 
you were begging me to stay till the sun rose
Strange words come on out of a grown man’s mouth when his minds broke
Pictures and passing time you only smile like that when you’re drinking
I wish I didn’t but I do, remember every moment on the nights with you

Rot gut whiskey gonna ease my mind

(Lyrics)
[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across thе border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'
[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising and entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
Said I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

Official ‘Cruel Summer’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift, Jack Antonoff & Annie Clark

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night 
You know that I caught it
bad bad boy
Shiny toy, with a price 
You know that I bought it 
killing me slow
Out the window
I’m always waiting for you to be waiting below Devils roll the dice
Angels roll their eyes 
What doesn’t kill me 
Makes me want you more And it’s new
The shape of your body 
It’s blue
The feeling I got and it’s 
Ooh 
It’s a cruel summer 
It’s cool
That’s what I tell ‘em
No rules in breakable heaven but 
Ooh 
It’s a cruel summer 
With you Hang your head low
In the glow of the vending machine
I’m not dying
We say that we’ll just screw 
it up in these trying times
We’re not trying 
So cut the headlights
Summer’s a knife
I’m always waiting for you just to cut to the bone 
Devils roll the dice
Angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed you’ll be the last to know Chorus I’m drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar
Said ‘I’m ﬁne’ but it wasn’t true
I don’t want to keep secrets 
Just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate every night that summer 
Just to seal my fate
And I scream ‘For whatever it’s worth,
I love you, ain’t that the worst thing you ever heard?’ He looks up grinning like a devil Chorus I’m drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar 
Said ‘I’m ﬁne’ but it wasn’t true
I don’t want to keep secrets 
Just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate every night that summer
Just to seal my fate
And I scream ‘For whatever it’s worth,
I love you, ain’t that the worst thing you ever heard?’

Can you snatch my soul from me
I don’t wanna wait come take it
Take me where I ain’t been before

Can you blow my mind 
Set off my whole body

Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breathe 
Make me water

Hopefully 
You can last all night don’t get too excited

You ain’t gotta go nowhere you can stay inside it

Can you blow my mind
Set off my whole body
If I give you my time

Can you snatch my soul from me
I don’t wanna wait come take it
Take me where I ain’t been before

Can you blow my mind 
Set off my whole body

Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breathe 
Make me water (x2)

Lyrics:
Last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all 
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night

I kiss your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack we split a fifth
Just talk about life goin' sip for sip
You, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me

I know that last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all 
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night
No way it was our last night

No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your momma, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah my, my friends say let her go
Your friends say what the hell
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else 

Oh baby, last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all 
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet

No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough 
I can’t remember everything we said but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But baby, baby somethin’s tellin’ me this ain’t over yet
No way it was our last night
No way it was our last night

I know you said this time you really weren’t coming back again,
But baby, baby somethin’s tellin’ me this ain’t over yet. 
No way it was our last night
No way it was our last night

Fuck You mean

Lyrics:
The truth is bulletproof
There’s no fooling you
I don't dress the same
 
Me and who you say
I was yesterday
Have gone our separate ways
 
Left my living fast
Somewhere in the past
Cause that's for chasing cars
 
Turns out open bars
Lead to broken hearts
And going way too far
 
I know I used to be crazy
I know I used to be fun
You say I used to be wild
I say I used to be young
 
You tell me time has done changed me
That's fine, I’ve had a good run
I know I used to be crazy
That’s cause I used to be young
 
Take one, pour it out
It’s not worth crying about
The things you can't erase
 
Like tattoos and regrets
Words I never meant
And ones that got away
 
Left my living fast
Somewhere in the past
And took another road
 
Turns out crowded rooms
Empty out as soon
There’s somewhere else to go ohhhhh
 
I know I used to be crazy
I know I used to be fun
You say I used to be wild
I say I used to be young
 
You tell me time has done changed me
That's fine, I’ve had a good run
I know I used to be crazy
That’s cause I used to be young 
 
Ohhhhh
 
I know I used to be crazy
Messed up but god was it fun
I know I used to be wild
That’s cause I used to be young
 
Those wasted nights are not wasted
I remember every one
I know I used to be crazy
That's cause I used to be young
 
You tell me time has done changed me
That's fine I’ve had a good run
I know I used to be crazy
That’s cause I used to be young

LYRICS

hate to give the satisfaction asking how you’re doing now
how’s the castle built off people you pretend to care about
just what you wanted
look at you, cool guy, you got it

i see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when i close my eyes
six months of torture
that you sold as some forbidden paradise
i loved you truly
gotta laugh at the stupidity

cuz i’ve made some real big mistakes
but you make the worst one look fine
i should’ve known it was strange
you only come out at night
i used to think i was smart
but you made
me look so naive
the way you sold me for parts
as you sunk your teeth into me, oh
bloodsucker, famefucker
bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire

every girl i ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
you called them crazy god i hate the way i called them crazy too
you’re so convincing
how do you lie without flinching
(how do you lie, how do you lie, how do you lie)

oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
can’t figure out just how you do it and god knows i never will
went for me and not her
cuz girls your age know better

i’ve made some real big mistakes
but you make the worst one look fine
i should’ve known it was strange
you only come out at night
i used to think i was smart
but you made me look so naive
the way you sold me for parts
as you sunk your teeth into me, oh
bloodsucker, famefucker
bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire

you said it was true love
but wouldn’t that be hard
you can’t love anyone
cuz that would mean you had a heart
i tried you help you out
now i know that i can’t
cuz how you think’s the kind of thing
i’ll never understand

i’ve made some real big mistakes
but you make the worst one look fine
i should’ve known it was strange
you only come out at night
i used to think i was smart
but you made me look so naive
the way you sold me for parts
as you sunk your teeth into me, oh
bloodsucker, famefucker
bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire

Lyrics:
We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can’t be sold 
We were right til we weren’t
Built a home and watched it burn 
 
I didn’t wanna leave you 
I didn’t wanna lie
Started to cry but then remembered I
 
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don’t understand 
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah I can love me better than you can
 
I can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
 
Paint my nails, cherry red 
Match the roses that you left 
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said 
 
I didn’t wanna wanna leave you 
I didn’t wanna fight 
Started to cry but then remembered I 
 
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don’t understand 
I can take myself dancing 
And I can hold my own hand 
Yeah I can love me better than you can 
 
I can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I
 
I didn’t wanna wanna leave you 
I didn’t wanna fight 
Started to cry but then remembered I 
 
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don’t understand 
I can take myself dancing 
And I can hold my own hand 
Yeah I can love me better than
Yeah I can love me better than you can
 
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby

As a spellbinding storyteller, sharp songwriter, powerhouse performer and history-making, platinum-certified phenomenon, Bailey Zimmerman has personified the American dream from the get-go. And now, with the release of his full-length debut LP, Religiously. The Album. (Warner Music Nashville/Elektra), this young artist with the rasp of a seasoned rocker and the heart of a sensitive songwriter surges to the forefront of 21st century country music and arrives at the cusp of superstardom. The album finds Zimmerman making a statement, amplifying tried-and-true country stories with unapologetic arena rock ambition and electrifying power from every angle. Alongside current single and title track “Religiously,” the album features his Multi-Platinum, debut #1 single, “Fall In Love,” alongside his most recent Multi-Platinum hit, “Rock And A Hard Place,” which spent a whopping six consecutive weeks at the top of Billboard’s Country Airplay Chart in addition to being his first Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 hit to date. Both tracks were also included on his record-shattering debut EP, Leave The Light On, which made history upon release as the biggest streaming country debut of all time and the most-streamed all-genre debut of the year. Quickly closing in on 2 billion streams and counting, Zimmerman closed out 2022 as the year’s only country artist to receive two Platinum certifications from the RIAA and was named Billboard’s #2 Top New Country Artist and #4 Top New Artist Overall. The 2023 ACM Awards New Male Artist of the Year nominee and CMT Music Awards multi-nominee has ignited television audiences with show-stopping performances on Good Morning America, Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve, Jimmy Kimmel LIVE! and the 58th Academy of Country Music Awards, and incited critical applause from Forbes, Rolling Stone, The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Billboard and many more. He’s out on the road now with Morgan Wallen as part of his monumental 2023 One Night At A Time Tour, and already selling out football stadiums coast-to-coast including SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, Wrigley Field in Chicago and Truist Park in Atlanta.

Lyrics: 
He said, are you serious
I’ve tried but i can’t figure out
I’ve been next to you all night and still don’t know what you’re about 
You keep talking
But not much coming out your mouth
Can’t you tell that i want you ?” 
I say, yeah

I would want myself 
Baby please believe me
I’ll put you through hell just to know me (ya ya) 
So sure of yourself 
Baby don’t get greedy 
That shit won’t end well
No it won’t end well 

I see you eyeing me down
But you’ll never know much past my name 
Or how i’m running this room around
And that i’m still half your age
Yeah you’re l-l-looking at me like i’m some sweet escape 
Obvious that you want me but i said

I would want myself
Baby please believe me
I’ll put you through hell just to know me yeah yeah 
So sure of yourself
Baby don’t get greedy
That shit won’t end well
No it won’t end well 

He said, “i’m just curious
Is this for real or just an act
Can’t tell if you love or hate me 
Never met someone like that
Drive me so so so crazy
Did you know you got that effect?”
I said, “lemme check”

Yeah
I would want myself
Baby please believe me 
I’ll put you through hell 
Just to know me yeah yeah 
So sure of yourself
Baby don’t get greedy
That shit won’t end well (end well)
No it won’t end well

I would want myself
I would want myself
I would want myself
I would want myself
I would want myself

Lyrics:
I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know, but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?

Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just somethin' you paid for
What was I made for?

'Cause I, I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might

Mm, mm, ah
Mm, mm, mm

When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
What was I made for?

'Cause I, 'cause I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might

Think I forgot how to be happy
Somethin' I'm not, but somethin' I can be
Somethin' I wait for
Somethin' I'm made for
Somethin' I'm made for

Lyrics
haven’t heard from you in a couple of months but i’m out right now and i’m all fucked up
and you’re calling my phone
you’re all alone
and i’m sensing some undertones

and i’m right here 
with all my friends
but you’re sending me your new address 
and i know we’re done i know we’re through
but god when i look at you
 
my brain goes ahhhh can’t hear my thoughts
(i can not hear my thoughts) like blah blah blah
(blah blah blah blah blah blah) should probably not
(i should probably probably not i should probably probably not) 

seeing you tonight
it’s a bad idea right? 
seeing you tonight it’s a bad idea right? 
seeing you tonight it’s a bad idea right? 
seeing you tonight fuck it, it’s fine

yes i know that he’s my ex
but can’t two people reconnect 
i only see him as a friend
the biggest lie i ever said
oh yes i know that he’s my ex but can’t two people reconnect 
i only see him as a friend
i just tripped and fell into his bed
 
now i’m getting in the car wrecking all my plans i know i should stop
but i can’t
and i told my friends i was asleep
but i never said where or in whose sheets
 
and i pull up to your place on the second floor and you’re standing smiling at the door
and i’m sure i’ve seen much hotter men 
but i really can’t remember when
 
my brain goes ahhhh can’t hear my thoughts
(i can not hear my thoughts) like blah blah blah
(blah blah blah blah blah blah) should probably not
(i should probably probably not i should probably probably not) 

seeing you tonight
it’s a bad idea right? 
seeing you tonight 
it’s a bad idea right? 
seeing you tonight 
it’s a bad idea right? 
seeing you tonight 
fuck it, its fine

yes i know that he’s my ex
but can’t two people reconnect 
i only see him as a friend
the biggest lie i ever said
oh yes i know that he’s my ex but can’t two people reconnect 
i only see him as a friend
i just tripped and fell into his bed
 
oh yes i know that he’s my ex can’t two people reconnect 
the biggest lie i ever said
i just tripped and fell into his bed 
my brain goes ahhh
can’t hear my thoughts 
the biggest lie i ever said 
my brain goes ahhh 
can’t hear my thoughts
i just tripped and fell into his bed

LYRICS:
I only talk to God when I need a favor
and I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So who the hell am I, who the hell am I to expect a savior (Oh oh)
if I only talk to God when I need a favor
God I need a favor

I know amazing grace, but I ain't been livin them words
Swear I spend most Sundays drunk off my ass than I have at church
Hard cover King James been only saving dust on the nightstand
And I don’t know what to say by the time I fold my hands

I only talk to God when I need a favor
and I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So who the hell am I, who the hell am I to expect a savior (Oh oh)
if I only talk to God when I need a favor
God I need a favor

Amen…Amen

I owe you more than one, and beggars can't be choosers
But I'll pay for all I’ve done just please don't let me lose her

I only talk to God when I need a favor
and I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So who the hell am I, who the hell am I to expect a savior (Oh oh)
if I only talk to God when I need a favor
God I need a favor

Amen…Amen…Amen…Amen

Hanging in there, just barely 
throwin’ up prayers, like hail mary's
If he's still there, lord spare me
Oh my God, oh my God – hail mary

Hanging in there, just barely 
throwin’ up prayers, like hail mary's
If he's still there, lord spare me
Oh my God, oh my God – hail mary

I only talk to God when I need a favor
and I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So tell me who the hell am I, to expect a savior 
when I only talk to God when I need a favor
God I need a favor

Amen
God I need a favor (whoa oh)
Amen

►Lyrics:
Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I’ve ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices, they come with prices and vices, I end up in crisis
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming one day I’ll watch as you’re leaving ‘cause you got tired of my scheming - for the last time

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I’m a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman 
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming 
one day I’ll watch as you’re leaving and life will lose all its meaning - for the last time 

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers ‘round and reads it
And then someone screams out
“She’s laughing up at us from hell!”

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me

It’s me
Hi

Everybody agrees
Everybody agrees

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Lyrics

Should I do it on the phone?
Should I leave a little note in the pocket of his coat?
(Yeah)
Maybe I’ll just disappear
I don’t wanna see a tear
And the weekend’s almost here

I’m picking out this dress
Trying on these shoes
Cause I’ll be single soon
I’ll be single soon
I know he’ll be a mess
When I break the news,
But I’ll be single soon
I’ll be single soon

Ima date who I wanna
Stay out late if I wanna
Ima do what I wanna do

I’m picking out this dress
Trying on these shoes
Cause I’ll be single soon

I’ll be single soon
I know I’m a little high maintenance
But I’m worth a try
Might not give a reason why
(Oh well)
We both had a lot of fun
Time to find another one
Blame it all on feeling young

I’m picking out this dress
Trying on these shoes
Cause I’ll be single soon
I’ll be single soon
I know he’ll be a mess
When I break the news-
But I’ll be single soon
I’ll be single soon

Ima date who I wanna
Stay out late if I wanna
Ima do what I wanna do

I’m picking out this dress
Trying on these shoes
Cause I’ll be single soon
I’ll be single soon

Yeah, I’ll be single soon
Yeah, I’ll be single soon
Yeah, I’ll be single soon
Yeah, I’ll be single soon

I’m picking out this dress
Trying on these shoes
Cause I’ll be single soon
I’ll be single soon

I know he’ll be a mess
When I break the news
But I’ll be single soon
I’ll be single soon

Ima date who I wanna
Stay out late if I wanna
Ima do what I wanna do

I’m picking out this dress
Trying on these shoes
Cause I’ll be single soon
I’ll be single soon

Oliver Anthony - Rich Men North Of Richmond,"When I first came across Oliver Anthony and his music, I was blown away to say the least.  He had a whole collection of songs that I could listen to for hours.  Oliver resides in Farmville, VA with his 3 dogs and a plot of land he plans on turning into a small farm to raise livestock.  We have a whole mess of songs set to release of Oliver for your viewing and listening pleasure, he is truly special and notes his biggest influence as Hank Williams Jr.  Oliver wants to give hope to the working class and your average hard working young man who may have lost hope in the grind of trying to get by.

Letra / Lyrics:
Ayer te vi,
solita
Esa carita bonita,
diablo que mamacita
Estás provocándome,
aunque lo haces sin querer,
Ya por tí pregunte
y hace más de un mes
te dejaste con el bobo aquel

Que hijueputas ganas tengo 
de besarte,
te vi en una foto y te imaginé 
sin ropa
te mentiría si no estoy loca 
por verte,
con ese jeancito como 
te ves de culona

Que hijueputas ganas tengo 
de besarte,
te vi en una foto y te imaginé 
sin ropa
te mentiría si no estoy loco
por darte,
con ese jeancito como 
te ves de culona

Nos vamos de guayeteo,
fumeteo en la disco 
mero perreo
te pusiste mini falda,
pa ver si yo te gateo,
un besito pa sentir
ese goteo,
y prende la cámara 
pa’ grabate un video 

No te voy a mentir,
no paro de imaginarme
tu culo en tanga
ponteme de espalda hasta
que el sol salga,
te ponga caliente 
y todo el cuerpo arda (arda)

Te ponga caliente, 
como la arena
y ese culito blanco el sol
te lo ponga moreno
Lo tiene grandote,
por el entreno
Empiece el toque toque,
mojaita’ flow sereno
Te ponga caliente, 
como la arena
y ese culito blanco el sol
te lo ponga moreno
Lo tiene grandote,
por el entreno
Empiece el toque toque,
mojaita’ flow sereno

Que hijueputas ganas tengo 
de besarte,
te vi en una foto y te imaginé 
sin ropa
te mentiría si no estoy loco
por darte,
con ese jeancito como 
te ves de culona

Que hijueputas ganas tengo 
de besarte,
te vi en una foto y te imaginé 
sin ropa
te mentiría si no estoy loca 
por verte,
con ese jeancito como 
te ves de culona

Ayer te vi,
solita
Esa carita bonita,
diablo que mamacita

Estás provocándome,
aunque lo haces sin querer,
Ya por tí pregunte
y hace más de un mes
te dejaste con el bobo aquel

Que hijueputas ganas tengo
de besarte (tengo de besarte)
Te mentiría si no estoy loca
por verte (por verte)
Cu-cu-cu Culona (culona)

Lyrics:
It always ends the same
when it was me and you
but every time I meet somebody new 
its like de ja vu

I swear they sound the same 
Its like they know my skin
every word they say sounds just like him 
and it goes like this

we’ll get in ur car and 
you’ll lean to kiss me 
we’ll talk for hours
and lie on the back seat 

Uh huh uh huh

Then one random night  
when everything changes  
You wont reply 
and we’ll go back to strangers 

Uh huh uh huh

it’s something that I hate 
how everyones disposable 
now every time I date somebody new 
I feel vulnerable 

that it’ll never change 
& it will just stay like this 
never ending dating breaking up
and it goes like this 

we’ll get in ur car and 
you’ll lean to kiss me 
we’ll talk for hours
and lie on the back seat 

Uh huh uh huh

Then one random night  
when everything changes  
You wont reply 
and we’ll go back to strangers 

Uh huh uh huh

It always ends the same
when it was me and u 
but every time I meet somebody new 
its like de ja vu

when we spoke for months 
did u ever mean it? 
how can they say that this is love?
when it goes like this

we’ll get in ur car and 
you’ll lean to kiss me 
we’ll talk for hours
and lie on the back seat 

Uh huh uh huh

Then one random night  
when everything changes  
You wont reply 
and we’ll go back to strangers 

Uh huh uh huh

Favorite Song

I’m on the stage right now
Singing your favorite song
Look in the crowd and you’re no where to be found as they sing along 
I say,
You look good without no makeup
No lashes even better when you wake up 
uh-uh-uh
I see the look on your face
I see ya hiding the hate
I see ya looking for someone to scoop you right off of your feet
You wanna ride in a Wraith
You wanna go out on dates
You want somebody to come bring you flowers
Someone to talk to for hours
Wash your back while y’all sit in the shower
Someone to tell you “you’re beautiful”
Someone to tell you and mean it
Someone to tell you I love you everyday
And don’t got a reason
You want someone to bring you peace
Someone to help you sleep
Someone to pick you up when you feeling down feeling lonely
Need somebody
Who can make it better
Somebody
Who can open up those gates
Open up those gates to your heart
Only if you’ll let me
I’m on the stage right now
Singing your favorite song
Look in the crowd and you’re no where to be found as they sing along 
I say,
You look good without no makeup
No lashes even better when you wake up 
uh-uh-uh
I see the look on you face
I see ya looking for peace
I see ya tired of the hurt
Tired of the pain 
Tired of the nights where you can’t get no sleep
I see you’re tired thinking bout if he cheat
See you’re tired thinking bout if you leaving
See you’re tired of being so tired
And ya damn sure ain’t getting even
Need somebody
Who can make it better
Somebody
Who can open up those gates
Open up those gates to your heart
Only if you’ll let me
I’m on the stage right now
Singing your favorite song
Look in the crowd and you’re no where to be found as they sing along 
I say,
You look good without no makeup
No lashes even better when you wake up 
uh-uh-uh

Lyrics: 
Verse 1
IT WAS RIGHT AFTER SENIOR YEAR
JUST BEFORE THE SUMMER DISAPPEARED
WE WENT RIDING THEM OLD FARM RUTS
HANGING OUT ON THE GATE OF HIS TRUCK
WE THREW A BLANKET NEATH THE SUNSET
BEING BRAVE AS EIGHTEEN GETS
WE GAVE EACH OTHER MORE THAN OUR HEARTS
WITH THE HELP OF A MASON JAR

CHORUS
 DRINKING WATERMELON MOONSHINE
 WE CUT THE BURN WITH A LITTLE LIME
 PARKING BACK IN THEM KUDZU VINES
 I WAS HIS AND EVERY BIT OF THAT BOY WAS MINE
 TOO YOUNG TO KNOW WHAT LOVE WAS
 BUT WE WERE LEARNING ON A SWEET BUZZ
 THERE’S NEVER NOTHING LIKE THE FIRST TIME
 AND MINE’S ALWAYS GONNA TASTE LIKE
 WATERMELON MOONSHINE

Verse 2 
I DON’T REMEMBER WHERE WE GOT IT FROM 
I JUST REMEMBER FEELING ALL GROWN UP 
TAKING PULLS LIKE IT AINT NO THING
NEVER TOLD HIM IT WAS MY FIRST DRINK 
BUT I TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS THE ONE 
YOU'RE SO SURE WHEN YOU'RE THAT YOUNG 
YOU THINK YOU GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT 
AND NOW I LAUGH WHEN I THINK ABOUT 

CHORUS
 DRINKING WATERMELON MOONSHINE
 WE CUT THE BURN WITH A LITTLE LIME
 PARKING BACK IN THEM KUDZU VINES
 I WAS HIS AND EVERY BIT OF THAT BOY WAS MINE
 TOO YOUNG TO KNOW WHAT LOVE WAS
 BUT WE WERE LEARNING ON A SWEET BUZZ
 THERE’S NEVER NOTHING LIKE THE FIRST TIME
 AND MINE’S ALWAYS GONNA TASTE LIKE
 WATERMELON MOONSHINE

BRIDGE 
I THOUGHT THAT HIGH WOULD LAST FOREVER 
BUT THAT AIN’T WHAT IT DOES
MAYBE WE WERE DRUNK IN LOVE 
OR MAYBE WE WERE JUST 


CHORUS
 DRINKING WATERMELON MOONSHINE
 WE CUT THE BURN WITH A LITTLE LIME
 PARKING BACK IN THEM KUDZU VINES
 I WAS HIS AND EVERY BIT OF THAT BOY WAS MINE
 TOO YOUNG TO KNOW WHAT LOVE WAS
 BUT WE WERE LEARNING ON A SWEET BUZZ
 THERE’S NEVER NOTHING LIKE THE FIRST TIME
 AND MINE’S ALWAYS GONNA TASTE LIKE
 WATERMELON MOONSHINE
 WATERMELON MOONSHINE

LYRICS:
Oh it’s like that
I’m your dream come true
When it’s on a platter for you
then you pull back
When i try to make plans
More than 2 hours in advance
I slam the door
I hit ignore
I’m saying no no no no more i
Got u blocked
After this
An after thought
I finally cut you off
I feel so much lighter
Like a feather
with you off my mind
Floating through
The memories like whatever
You’re a waste of time
Your Signals are Mixed
You act like a bitch
you fit every stereotype
send a pic
I feel so much lighter
Like a feather
With you out my life
It Feels
So
Good
Not caring where u are tonight
And it feels so good
Not pretending to like the wine u like
I slam the door
I hit ignore
I’m saying no no no no more i
Got u blocked
Excited
To never talk
I I’m so sorry for your loss
I feel so much lighter
Like a feather
with you off my mind
Floating through
The memories like whatever
You’re a waste of time
your Signals are Mixed
You act like a bitch
you fit every stereotype
send a pic
I feel so much lighter
Like a feather
With you out my life
You want me
I’m done
You miss me
No duh
Where I’m at
I’m up
/ like a feather like a feather like a feather
