Lyrics:

Ooh
Na na, yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
So
I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time
I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said I make you cry when I run away
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (Ooh, yeah)
Save your tears for another day (Yeah)
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl (Ah)
I said save your tears for another day (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)

Lyrics:
We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can’t be sold 
We were right til we weren’t
Built a home and watched it burn 
 
I didn’t wanna leave you 
I didn’t wanna lie
Started to cry but then remembered I
 
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don’t understand 
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah I can love me better than you can
 
I can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
 
Paint my nails, cherry red 
Match the roses that you left 
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said 
 
I didn’t wanna wanna leave you 
I didn’t wanna fight 
Started to cry but then remembered I 
 
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don’t understand 
I can take myself dancing 
And I can hold my own hand 
Yeah I can love me better than you can 
 
I can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I
 
I didn’t wanna wanna leave you 
I didn’t wanna fight 
Started to cry but then remembered I 
 
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don’t understand 
I can take myself dancing 
And I can hold my own hand 
Yeah I can love me better than
Yeah I can love me better than you can
 
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better

Lyrics 

I’m going under and this time I fear there’s no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy

I need somebody to heal
somebody to know
somebody to have
somebody to hold
It’s easy to say
but it’s never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now the day bleeds, into nightfall
and you’re not here, to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I’m going under and this time I fear there’s no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now I need somebody to know 
somebody to heal 
somebody to have 
just to know how it feels
It’s easy to say
but it’s never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape

Now the day bleeds, into nightfall 
and you’re not here, to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms 
I'll be safe in your sound til I come back around

For now the day bleeds, into nightfall 
and you’re not here, to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

But now the day bleeds, into nightfall 
and you’re not here, to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

-- | LYRICS |--

The club isn’t the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go 
Me and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow
you come over and start up a conversation with just me and trust me I’ll give it a chance now
Take my hand stop, put van the man on the jukebox and then we start to dance
And now I’m singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy don’t mind me 
Say boy let’s not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with your body

Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you 

One week in we let the story begin
We’re going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat 
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family’s doing ok
leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
and I'm singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead 
I may be crazy, don’t mind me
Say boy let’s not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new

Well I’m in love with your body
Oh I x 4 
I’m in love with your body
Oh I x 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you 

Come on be my baby come on X 8

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new

Well I’m in love with your body
Come on be my baby come on X 6
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you

David Kushner - Daylight (Official Music Video),"“Daylight” out now on all platforms: https://davidkushner.lnk.to/daylight

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Telling myself I won't go there
Oh, but I know that I won't care
Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilt
This lust is a burden that we both share
Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer
Souls tied, intertwined by pride and guilt

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh) There's darkness in the distance
From the way that I've been livin'
(Ooh) But I know I can't resist it

[Chorus]
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from thе daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hatе it at the same time

[Verse 2]
Tellin' myself it's the last time
Can you spare any mercy that you might find
If I'm down on my knees again?
Deep down, way down, Lord, I try
Try to follow your light, but it's nighttime
Please don't leave me in the end

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh) There's darkness in the distance
I'm beggin' for forgiveness
(Ooh) But I know I might resist it, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time

You always take me down, down, down

Tell me, how come when I’m guiding your steps
It’s always hard to see it
How come you don’t wanna confess
Now it’s too late I’m done

Yeah, I don’t need you when 
Lonely, thinking about the times when you call me
I’m always on your mind when you’re going down, down, down
You always take me down, down, down""

His incredible catalogue includes the studio albums ‘+’ (plus), ‘x’ (multiply) and ‘÷’ (divide) which spawned hit singles such as ‘The A team’ , ’Lego House’, ‘Sing', ‘Thinking Out Loud’, ‘Photograph’, ‘Shape Of You’, ‘Castle on The Hill’ and ‘Perfect’. 
 
In 2019, Ed Sheeran released the genre-spanning ‘No.6 Collaborations Project’ which featured a wide-range of artists including ‘Justin Bieber’, ‘Camilla’ Cabello’, ‘Travis Scott’, ‘Eminem’, ‘Cardi B, ‘Paulo Londra’, ‘Bruno Mars’ and ‘Stormzy’ amongst many others, producing hits such as ‘I Don’t Care’, ‘Beautiful People’, ‘South of The Border’ and ‘Take Me Back To London’.

Lyrics
Holding me back,
Gravity’s holding me back,
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand,
Why don’t we leave it at that?,
Nothing to say,
When everything gets in the way,
Seems you cannot be replaced,
And I’m the one who will stay,
Ooh,
 
In this world,
It’s just us,
You know it’s not the same as it was,
In this world,
It’s just us,
You know it’s not the same as it was,
As it was,
As it was,
You know it’s not the same,
 
Answer the phone,
“Harry, you’re no good alone,
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?,
What kind of pills are you on?”,
Ringing the bell,
And nobody’s coming to help,
Your daddy lives by himself,
He just wants to know that you’re well,
Ooh,
 
In this world,
It’s just us,
You know it’s not the same as it was,
In this world,
It’s just us,
You know it’s not the same as it was,
As it was,
As it was,
You know it’s not the same,
 
Go home,
Get ahead, 
Light speed internet,
I don’t want to talk about the way that it was,
Leave America, 
Two kids follow her,
I don’t want to talk about who’s doing it first,
(Hey!),
 
As it was,
You know it’s not the same as it was,
As it was,
As it was,

Lyrics below:
I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river, and it made me complete

Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And if you have a minute, why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know?

Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And if you have a minute, why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go?
So why don't we go?
Ooh-aah, oh

This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know
Somewhere only we know

Kelsie Kimberlin - Turn Back - Official Video #StandWithUkraine,"My new video ""Turn Back"" is the third of the trilogy of videos I filmed in Ukraine in August, 2023. It has multiple meanings depending on the place in which you find yourself.  For many people, it is a plea to a loved one who looking for something somewhere else to find it right there at home.  But for me, this song and video are about Ukraine. First, it is a call for those millions of refugees who left Ukraine after the war began to come back home to help Ukraine rebuild.  Ukraine needs you and this is where your heart remains.  Second, it expresses the longing of all those Ukrainians who have a  friend or family member fighting near or far to come back home alive. In the video, you can see photos of thousands of soldiers who died defending Ukraine. Those photos are posted on The Wall of Remembrance next to St. Michael's Cathedral in Kyiv, the bells of which were heard all over Kyiv in December 2013 at the beginning of the “Revolution of Dignity” of Euromaidan. Ten years ago, there were only 100 photos on that wall of the “Heavenly Hundred” who were killed by terrorists at Maidan in Kyiv. Now there are more than ten thousands photos with more added every day. The destroyed enemy tanks and heavy military equipment shown in the video are set up in the square next to the cathedral to remind people of the terror unleashed against innocent Ukrainians. These three videos form a trilogy of modern Ukrainian history, showing the dignity, strength and desire that ordinary Ukrainians stand for despite horrific difficulties.  They went through ""Armageddon"" to get ""Another Chance to Live Again"" and finally ""Turn Back"" to a normal life where there is love, happiness and independence. Through these songs and videos, I am acting as a chronicler, calling on people from all over the world not only to feel the severity of the war, but also to help the Ukrainians get back what belongs to them.  My harmonies are in a polyphonic form where separate vocals alternately hand off or differentiate the melody with a mesmerizing, haunting and calming effect. I laid those tracks as you hear them without the use of autotune or a harmonizer. 

Please like, comment, share and support Ukraine. After I returned from Ukraine, I launched a foundation to help those injured and to raise funds for reconstruction. Please donate if you can. www.KelsieKimberlinFoundation.org 

TURN BACK 
Honey, where are you going to, turn back you belong with me
There is nothing out there for you, you got everything here

No I don’t think that you can make it by yourself
And I don’t think that you can stay away for long

You gotta come home to me, it is where you are most happy
You gotta come home you’ll see, it is where you ought to be

You are looking for something, I know where you’ll find it
Come on back from where you left from, I am here waiting

Keep me close to your heart, when you’re out there alone
Searching, I know that you find me, right here back at our home

No I don’t think that I can make it by yourself
And I don’t think that I can live here without you

You gotta come home to me, it is where you are most happy
You gotta come home you’ll see, it is where you ought to be

Lyrics:
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
‘Cause I am capable of anything
Of anything and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don’t make me your enemy
Your enemy, your enemy

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you’re fallin’ for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‘Cause I’m coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‘Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine
There’s no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away
Don’t walk away
It’s in the palm of your hand now, baby
It’s a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure
Before you give it all to me
All to me
Give it all to me

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you’re fallin’ for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‘Cause I’m coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‘Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine
There’s no going back

(Juicy J)
She’s a beast
I call her Karma
She’ll eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer

Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shorty heart is on steroids
‘Cause her love is so strong

You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance, you better keep her
She’s sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She’ll turn cold as a freezer

That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I’m gon’ put her in a coma

Now I think I love her
Shorty so bad, sprung and I don’t care
She ride me like a roller coaster
Turned the bedroom into a fair

Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil’ mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you’re fallin’ for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‘Cause I’m coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‘Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine
There’s no going back

Lyrics:

Verse 1:
Every night, I've been calling, like you've got me hypnotised
Can't help myself,
It's like all the time, I try to be without you, but you're on my mind, every single night

Pre-Chorus:
I tell myself that I'll be better off without you, but you and I know that's a lie
And I can't get you out of my mind
It's like you've got me hypnotised

Drop:
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah
I can't get you out of my mind
I'm hypnotised

Post-Chorus:
And if only you would say that I do the very same to you
That I'm on your mind
Tell me it’s true
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah
I can't get you out of my mind
I'm hypnotised

Verse 2:
Don't let me down,
Don't say when you hear my name, it doesn’t resonate,
Within your head,
Is it hurting now, like me when I just need you, but you're not around

Pre-Chorus:
I tell myself that I’ll be better off without you, but you and I know that’s a lie
And I can't get you out of my mind
It's like you've got me hypnotised

Drop:
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah
I can’t get you out of my mind
I'm hypnotised",PT2M20S,735067,10,2024-01-04T13:00:18Z

LYRICS:
Well you done done me in; you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back

Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find
Love, love, love, love

Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be
Loved, love, love, love, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do you want to come on scootch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait – I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and damn you're free (No more, no more)
Look into your heart and you'll find (It cannot wait)
The sky is yours (I'm sure)
So please don't, please don't, please don't (No need to complicate)
There's no need to complicate (Our time is short)
'Cause our time is short (This is)
This oh, this oh, this is our fate (our fate)
I'm yours

""Let Her Go"" [Lyrics]

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much
And you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go
And you let her go
Well you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

LYRICS
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything.

Uh!
I'm gonna kick my feet up
Then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't

I'll be lounging on the couch,
Just chillin' in my snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man

Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all!
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh

Tomorrow I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out: 'This is Great' (Oh my God, this is great)
Yeah

I might mess around, get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait
Haha

Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

Lyrics:

Every night, I've been calling, like you've got me hypnotized.
Can't help myself,
It's like all the time, I try to be without you, but you're on my mind every single night.

I tell myself that I'll be better off without you, but you and I know that's a lie.
And I can't get you out of my mind.
It's like you've got me hypnotized.

Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah,
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah,
I can't get you out of my mind,
I'm hypnotized.

And if only you would say that I do the very same to you,
That I'm on your mind,
Tell me it’s true.
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah,
I can't get you out of my mind,
I'm hypnotized.

Don't let me down,
Don't say when you hear my name, it doesn’t resonate
Within your head.
Is it hurting now, like me when I just need you, but you're not around?

I tell myself that I’ll be better off without you, but you and I know that’s a lie.
And I can't get you out of my mind.
It's like you've got me hypnotized.

Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah,
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah,
I can’t get you out of my mind,
I'm hypnotized.",PT2M33S,4145776,10,2023-11-30T15:00:39Z

Lyrics:
One, one, one, one, one...

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I... (I got new...)

One: Don't pick up the phone (yeah)
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
Two: Don't let him in (uh-ooh)
You'll have to kick him out again (again)
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Baby, you know I count 'em)
I gotta tell them to myself

Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
You're gettin' over him

Lyrics:
Been runnin on these lonely streets
For so long
To put my mind at ease
With this song
Lalarilari lalarirari lalarirari
Im Done

They said be the person you needed as a kid
But life just a circle of mess were you cant breath
So i put my mind at ease
With this song
Lalalrirari Lalarirari
I’m Done

Foot loose and fancy free
I dance just to release my dopamine
Overdosed by society
I'm breaking up with those who limit me

Cause I just want
This night
To last
Forever

They said be the person you needed as a kid
But life just a circle of mess were you cant breath
So i put my mind at ease
With this song
Lalalrirari Lalarirari
I’m Done

Lyrics:

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
You know you want me
So don’t keep saying our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away
And out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide
That you’re my destiny?

What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours
Tonight

You think it's easy
You think I don't want to run to you, yeah
But there are mountains (There are mountains)
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you’re wondering why
Because we’re able to be
Just you and me
Within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

No one can rewrite the stars (Rewrite the stars)
How can you say you’ll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
(The one you were meant to find)
It's not up to you, it's not up to me, yeah
When everyone tells us what we can be (Tells us what we can)
And how can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours tonight (Be ours)

All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
It’s not impossible
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible

And how do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
And nothing can keep us apart
'Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one could say what we get to be
And why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changing the world to be ours

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
But I can't have you
We're bound to break and my hands are tied

About Anne-Marie:
Anne-Marie has proved to be one of the UK’s most exciting and successful British breakthrough popstars of recent years. A former 3x world karate champion and West End child star-turned 9x BRIT Award nominee, A-M’s rise has been nothing short of meteoric. In 2018 Anne-Marie released her debut album, ‘Speak Your Mind’ which featured the hit singles 'Alarm', 'Ciao Adios', 'Heavy', 'Friends', '2002' and 'Perfect to Me'. She subsequently ended that year as as the UK’s biggest-selling debut artist, selling out headline shows and playing stadium dates supporting long-time friend and champion Ed Sheeran in the process.

She has also sang on and co-written many other hits such as Birthday, Rockabye, Don't Leave Me Alone,  To Be Young, f*ck, i'm lonely and Don't Play, collaborating with the likes of Clean Bandit, Marshmello, David Guetta, Lauv, Rudimental, Doja Cat and KSI, as well as starring on The Greatest Showman: Reimagined soundtrack performing Rewrite the stars alongside James Arthur.

Lyrics:
I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know, but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?

Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just somethin' you paid for
What was I made for?

'Cause I, I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might

Mm, mm, ah
Mm, mm, mm

When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
What was I made for?

'Cause I, 'cause I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might

Think I forgot how to be happy
Somethin' I'm not, but somethin' I can be
Somethin' I wait for
Somethin' I'm made for
Somethin' I'm made for

Lyrics:
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sit quietly
Agree politely
 
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing
So I fell for everything
 
(Pre-Chorus)
You held me down but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
 
You held me down but I got up
Get ready ’cause I’ve had enough
I see it all, I see it now
 
(Chorus)
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
‘Cause I am a champion
And you’re gonna hear me roar
 
Louder, louder than a lion
‘Cause I am a champion
And you’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
 
Now I’m floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero
To my own hero
 
(Pre-Chorus)
You held me down but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
 
You held me down but I got up
Get ready ’cause I’ve had enough
I see it all, I see it now
 
(Chorus)
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
‘Cause I am a champion
And you’re gonna hear me roar

Lyrics: 
Baby you can
Find me under the lights
Diamonds under my eyes
Turn the rhythm up
Don’t you wanna just
Come along for the ride

Oh my outfit so tight
You can see my heart beat tonight
I can take the heat
Baby best believe
That’s the moment I shine

Cuz every romance
Shakes and it bends
Don’t give a damn

When the nights here
I don’t do tears
Baby no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won’t see it on my face
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I’ll still keep the party running not one hair out of place

Lately I’ve been
Moving close to the edge
Still be looking my best
I stay on the beat
You can count on me
I ain’t missing no steps

Cuz every romance
Shakes and it bends
Don’t give a damn

When the nights here
I don’t do tears
Baby no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance 
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won’t see it on my face 
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I’ll still keep the party running not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks
You’ll never see it, never see it
When my world shakes
I feel alive, I feel alive
I don’t play safe
Don’t you know about me

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Even when the tears are flowing
They’re diamonds on my face
I’ll still keep the party going not one hair out of place
Even when the tears are flowing
They’re diamonds on my face
I’ll still keep the party going not one hair out of place

Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won’t see it on my face
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I’ll still keep the party running not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks
You’ll never see it, never see it
When my world shakes
I feel alive, I feel alive
I don’t play safe
Don’t you know about me

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Dance the night

Lyrics:
I know what's to be sacred
Always knew
I know a lot of secrets
Don't know you

And everyone's gone now
Just the two of us
I know a lot of secrets
But don't know you

Biting my lips, longing for you, you
Searching for the room with open doors, we close them
Everything we do can be a secret that we keep
A secret that we keep

I just want your love
Your love
Your love can take me higher

I just want your love
Your love
So we can start a fire

I know what's to be sacred
Always knew
I know a lot of secrets
Don't know you

And everyone's gone now
Just the two of us
I know a lot of secrets
But don't know you

Biting my lips, longing for you, you
Searching for the room with open doors, we close them
Everything we do can be a secret that we keep
A secret that we keep

I just want your love
Your love
Your love can take me higher

I just want your love
Your love
So we can start a fire",PT2M40S,11736326,10,2023-04-25T14:00:43Z

“I Ain’t Worried” Lyrics:
i don’t know what you’ve been told
but time is running out no need to take it slow
im stepping to you toe to toe
i should be scared honey maybe so

but i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
swimmin in the floods, dancing on the clouds, below

i aint worried bout it
i aint worried bout it

I don’t know what you’ve been told
but time is running out so spend it like its gold
im living like I’m 9 zeros
got no regrets even when I’m broke
yeah
im at my best when i got something
im wanting to steal
way too busy for them problems
and problems to feel (yeah yeah)
no stressing just obsessin with sealin the deal
ill take it in and let it go

but i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
swimmin in the floods, dancing on the clouds, below

i aint worried bout it
i aint worried bout it

oooooooooo
i aint worried
oooooooo
oh no no

i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
swimmin in the floods, dancing on the clouds, below
i aint worried bout it
i aint worried bout it
i aint worried bout it

***

You are always waiting at the gate
behind the window you feel safe
I barely can’t hear what you say
Give it up give it up you won’t stop me
I know exactly what you’re hiding
Everybody knows
So lets skip the talking
Give it up give it up you won’t stop me

Are you locked in your hideout ?
Or are you locked out from your retreat ?

Lyrics:
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for you

Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la, yeah

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need you
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave you
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la la la
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't you let me fall

Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need you
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for you
All along I've been coming for you
And I hope it meant something to you
Call my name, I'll be coming for you
Coming for you, coming for you, coming for you

For you (ooh, she loves it when I come)
For you

Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for you

Lyrics: 
 
VERSE 1:

When I got tired of one-night stands
When everybody wants to hold my hands
I met you, baby, not just for fun 
Cause I’m so done and I’m ready to run

One, come and close my eyes 
Two, tell me I want you 

CHORUS:

On a magical night 
I wanna play you like you’re a symphony
I know you wanna get the best of me
Let’s hide in this New Year 
Where you and me, you and me

On a magical night 
Your body kills me when I look at you 
I’d give my money for your love love’s proof
I got this feeling yeah you know it’s true
Win or lose
On a magical night 

VERSE 2:

Well I hope you will stay with me
Cause I don’t wanna feel alone and free
I’m gonna pray for burning love 
As unholy touch revives me, baby, now 

One, come and close my eyes 
Two, tell me I want you 


CHORUS:

On a magical night 
I wanna play you like you’re a symphony
I know you wanna get the best of me
Let’s hide in this New Year 
Where you and me, you and me

On a magical night 
Your body kills me when I look at you 
I’d give my money for your love love’s proof
I got this feeling yeah you know it’s true
Win or lose
On a magical night
On a magical night

Lyrics: 
Once I was seven years old my mama told me, 
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big, big world but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor 
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me, 
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
‘Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was twenty years old my story got told
Before the morning sun when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old

I only see my goals I don't believe in failure
‘Cause I know the smallest voices they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave I hope I'll see you later

Once I was twenty years old my story got told 
I waswriting 'bout everything I saw before me
Once I was twenty years old

Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold 
We'vetraveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one 
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be sixty years old
